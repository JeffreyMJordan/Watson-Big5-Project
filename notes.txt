I currently need to enable CORS to use the Watson API on the client side 
To do this, I need to set up some way that I request a token and include it with my request in the header 


In the webpack example, IBM used it like this:

var ltAuthService = new watson.AuthorizationV1({
  username: ,
  password: ,
  url: watson.ToneAnalyzerV3.URL
});

app.get('/api/token/tone_analyzer', function(req, res) {
  ltAuthService.getToken(function(err, token) {
    if (err) {
      console.log('Error retrieving token: ', err);
      return res.status(500).send('Error retrieving token');
    }
    res.send(token);
  });
});




It seems like I'm gonna have to set up a server with express 
This should be decent practice using express, lol

How do I structure the components? 
Maybe I could start with a text form, have them submit it, 
then have a component to display the assessment? 
Yeah, I like it 

I think my workflow should be as follows 

1. Complete text form 
2. Complete facebook login (this is more interesting)
3. Visualize the Watson Big5 assessment


I'll just display the raw JSON object for the time being, lol 


Facebook says they don't want people doing sentiment analysis with their API...
Hmmm, maybe I could use a different api? What about twitter? 


Twitter is a good option
I could have users just upload a twitter url 
Yeah, that's a good idea 



Ok, so the twitter username is working 
Now to add a visualization 
Actually, lemme do the css first
